# Todos

* the original image is build for non-root solution but for some reason now is not, make it become non-root
* you might not need that many user, check if the user is for security issue or any other thing
* the image size is very big in current state, minimize the size using maybe stage build
* the local save import mechanism is...worked, but ugly, design a better flow for import local save
* serverconfig.xml is hard to edit, but the config schema may update, find a way to easily edit it, may not have a good solution but try it

# Questions

* Should we support multi-saves for import since the server can only open one game in one session?
